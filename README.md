## Simple computer networking project for my university made in **cisco packet tracer**
For this project I used protocols **DHCP, OSPF, RIP, ACL, TELNET, DNS** , and some addresses I set manually.
Routing areas with their routing protocols are marked with circles and text fields, also you can see the address there.

This is how the configuration should look like
